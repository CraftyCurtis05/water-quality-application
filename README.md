Utilized Spring Boot framework and Lombok dependency injection within Intellij IDEA to create methods that connect to databases within PostgreSQL using JPA to create and manage water sensors and their data with CRUD methods.

"Water Quality"  - Completed exception handling and integration testing; Implemented controllers, dto's, entity's, repository's and services for sensors, sensor data and reports. Utilized dependency injection to create beans for each, using annotations, along with using Lombok for getters, setters and constructors. Setup application utility and configuration, along with multiple application YML files for separate environments, including development, production and testing. Added user registration and login authentication and authorization based-off of specific roles.
